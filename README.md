# Project 3: Community Website - Determined

Collaboratively, each team will build the same website for the **Determined** project in a friendly competition to ensure the best outcome.

## Objective

Collaboratively create a website for the **Determined** project. The design of the website and contents have been created by our community partners and can be found in [this presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGVo3IPoCw/uAjYA68088zE2myqO3DRbA/view?utm_content=DAGVo3IPoCw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=hb676cd3008). Your task is to implement the website that has been presented, with design enhancements only when neccessary. If some information is unavailable, it is also fine to use placeholder values/information (e.g., points) -- you do not need to do research on the subject to ensure accurate information.

## Overview

- **Project Duration:** March 17 -  May 5 
- **Teams:** Pre-determined by the instructor.
- **Deliverables:** Website that satisifies the needs of the community partner, functions correctly, is accessible and responsive.
- **Repository:** Implementation and reports will be done in `project3` repository. Website implementation must be done in branches.

## Project Learning Outcomes

- Apply design and development principles from the course to develop the website.
- Enhance user experience (UX), accessibility, and visual appeal.
- Ensure functionality, responsiveness, and maintainability.
- Practice collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.

### Connection to Course and Distribution Learning Outcomes

The project learning outcomes apply to all course and distribution learning outcomes reproduced below.

- **Course Learning Outcomes:**
  - Apply HTML, CSS, Markdown, and basic Javascript to develop well-structured, responsive World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant web sites.
  - Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
  - Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
  - Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.

- **Distribution Learning Outcomes:**
  - **IP: International & Intercultural Perspectives (IP):**
    - Demonstrate an understanding of cultural complexity and difference.
  - **SP: Scientific Process & Knowledge (SP):**
    - Demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

## Requirements gathered from class
- **Purpose**: Create a "substance use empathy" game inspired by text-based or scenario-driven formats (e.g., Oregon Trail, Spent).
- **Audience**: Primarily high school and college students, plus general community workshop participants.
- **Key Pages**: Home/landing, About, Resources, Settings, Character creation/selection, Game scenario pages.
- **Features**:
  - Use/Resist point tracking for decisions.
  - Possible toolbox (coping strategies) and phone (hotline/support) for help in tough scenarios.
  - Random/unpredictable events tied to character attributes.
- **Accessibility**: Dyslexic-friendly fonts, adjustable text size, colorblind color schemes, text-to-speech support.
- **Tone & Style**: Serious but empathetic, with a jarring or "uncomfortable" color scheme (often neon green/purple/black) to reflect the gravity of substance abuse.
- **Cultural & Language Considerations**: English only for now, but open to future translation. Avoid stereotypes in character scenarios.
- **Updates & Hosting**: Infrequent updates (at most once a year). Domain not purchased yet. Assistance needed for hosting.
- **Additional Notes**: The website should serve as a teaching tool and encourage empathy, offering real-life resources for help and information.    

## Project Milestones

Project milestones will be conducted in two sprints with the speicific tasks undertaken in each sprint primarily determined by each team. Roughly half of the website tasks should be finished by the end of sprint 1. It is each team's responsibility to manage the tasks

### Sprint 1
### DUE: April 4, 2025 by 10am

- **Key Dates:**
  - March 26th, 10am: Review of the website progress (must at least have the skeleton)
  - April 4th, 10am: Review of the website progress (about half of the work must be done by this point)

### Sprint 2
### DUE: May 5, 2025 by 9am

- **Key Dates:**
  - April 14th, 2:30pm: Review of the website progress (must have majority of the functionality)
  - April 28th, 2:30pm: Presentation (website should be complete minus some minor enhancements) 
  - May 5th, by 9am: Submit the final version of the website with all feedback addressed

- **Development Process:**
  - Create a project board 
  - Create and manage issues in your project 3 repo
  - Link issues to your project board
  - Use branching strategy with pull requests
  - Minimum of 2 team member reviews per PR

## Assessment Criteria

This project is assessed on a pass/fail basis as discussed in the syllabus. To receive credit for this assignment, you must pass each sprint. While the completion of overall project requirements are assessed on a whole team basis, each team member will also be assessed based on their visible contributions (commits, PRs, presentations) and also peer evaluation. You must meet the following criteria:

- **Team Evaluation**
  - Fully implemented website that is technically correct
  - Implementation of all required features
  - Proper responsive design implementation
  - WCAG compliance for accessibility
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Successful deployment of the website
  - Comprehensive report for each sprint
  - Functioning GitHub project board with linked issues
**Note: team whose website is selected by the community partners will automatically pass "team evaluation" event if some of the items above are not complete.**  

- **Individual Evaluation**
  - Active participation in team meetings and discussions
  - Regular contributions to individual project branch(es) (must show up on GitHub and be comparable to the rest of the team)
  - Regular creation and approval of pull requests (PRs) with at least two reviews (at least one PR per person per sprint)
  - Meaningful participation in the review sessions
  - Completion of assigned tasks (GitHub issues) in individual branches
